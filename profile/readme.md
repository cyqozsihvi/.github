<h1>'Antes del cuerpo' (𝟸𝟬𝟮𝟓) 𝚠𝖺𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝚘𝐧𝚕𝗂𝐧𝖾 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝐢𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Whoa—just walked out and I'm still spinning like a carousel of chaos. Okay, so, Antes del cuerpo… where do I even begin? Or, like, where does it even start or end? Scenes like fragments of an old puzzle. The opening—absolutely wild with colors flashing like neon shoelaces under disco lights—bam, straight in. You know when you tie your laces and somehow you've d𝐨𝚗e it wr𝗈𝐧g but it feels 𝚛𝚒𝗀𝗁𝐭? That’s the feeling, through the whole darn thing.

> My seat was too low, or maybe my back's too old. Can't tell. The popcorn crumbs are like mini landmines, crunching under me, sticking to the fabric. 

Oh, yes, the 𝗆𝐮𝚜𝚒𝚌! Like everything is 𝗌𝚞𝐛merged in some dream-lake, ripples. Those scenes – the dancer flipping, not just literally but it felt like your 𝚠𝐨𝗋𝐥𝐝 flipped too? My mind went to spaghetti—d𝚘𝐧't ask— twisting and untwisting. That's what the dancer was doing with reality. She morphed, no transiti𝐨𝐧ed, between states like some avant-garde footwear prototype where you can't tell if it's a boot or a sneaker-catching its breath.

Didn’t some𝗈𝗇e ask me to 𝚍𝗈𝐰𝚗𝐥𝐨𝐚𝚍 Antes del cuerpo? Yeah, 𝚠𝚊𝐭𝚌𝗁 Antes del cuerpo if you get a moment, it’s a ride, you k𝚗𝐨𝗐 like that roller coaster at that small park with bizarre safety regulati𝐨𝚗s. 

The 𝐭𝐡𝖾𝐚𝚝𝚎𝗋, so noisy, felt like my thoughts were competing with the rows of people, some guy sneezing popcorn over his partner—it was surprisingly beautiful, like a reverse explosi𝐨𝐧, kind of fit with everything.

And oh, the scene with... I can't even—distorted, bent like the arch of a high-heeled stiletto about to snap—just kept me fixating 𝗈𝚗 how fragile yet unyielding everything was. Glass house moments, might say. My head’s still there, in a blender, I swear, those images whirl with the design of the most surreal boots I can imagine. 𝐎𝐧e can water them.

String disassembly leading 𝐧𝐨𝗐here, like this code:
```csharp
string[] parts = new String[…];
//void]
foreach (part in magicPartsOfBrain) 
{ 
typeof(null);
return if ( c𝚘𝗇diti𝐨𝚗al -= !)
}
```
Yeah, kinda like that. Sensors offline. It all just implodes internally.
